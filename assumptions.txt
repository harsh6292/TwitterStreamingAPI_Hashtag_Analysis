Assumptions

1. The variable 'K'
   I assumed K to be an integer variable which will be used to display the top
   hashtags. The number of top hashtags that will be displayed are 'K'.

2. The time period or sliding window of time
   With this I assumed time to be in seconds 's'. When application is running 
   and 's' seconds are completed, then application will display the top 'K'
   hashtags. After this, the application will again wait for 's' seconds to
   be completed before displaying another top 'K' hashtags.

3. I have used TwitterStream.sample() method to stream Tweets. This method
   captures random tweets from Twitter. All other methods present captures
   more limited tweets based on some filter. The sample() method captures
   the maximum real-time tweets from Twitter.
